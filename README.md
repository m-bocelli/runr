# runr

Rust hypervisor-based Docker runtime to launch regular Docker images as virtual machines instead of runc containers.

Goals:
- Reduce container escape probability
- Faster runtime than similar projects via leveraging RustVMM

# Installation

Prerequisites:
- KVM enabled host kernel (tested on Ubuntu 22.04)

```
# Install Rust and Cargo
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# Install Docker
apt update
apt install docker.io

# Grab the source code
git clone https://github.com/m-bocelli/runr

# Change into dir
cd runr

# Build the debug binary (no stable release)

# Running

```
# Launch a BusyBox Docker image inside a runr container with 256mib of memory
